      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
      The Asian Restaurant is easily accessible and convenient with a subway station five minutes down the street and 
      several bus stands round the block. The restaurant also has it's own reserved parking area. We firmly believe that
      a sumptuous meal is best enjoyed without having to think about parking nuances. We strive to please. <br><br>

      Our executive chef is Jimmy Xi Chang, of the Easy Chinese Cooking fame, featured in Food Network.
      He also starred as a guest chef in season 5 of Masterchef Australia. His signature dish, the peking duck fillet with 
      white fungus and pork sauce is now an international phenomenon. <br><br>

      To compliment such exemplary culinary skills, Josh Kaper, the renowned hospitality and commercial interior designer, 
      has worked on the decor of the restaurant. Utilizing the existing structure of an old fire department headquarter, 
      the tall arched windows offer pleasant sunlight during the day, and a view of the fast paced nightlife in the
      evenings. The garage shutters have been bolted shut into place and we have retained the old glass panels.
      Red and gold dragons and phoenixes  in abstract shapes adorn the ceiling. It is a beautiful blend of traditional
      and contemporary deisigns.<br><br>

      <h2>THE STORY</h2>
      <p>    
      Cantonese is the is the dialect of Yue Chinese spoken in the vicinity of Canton (i.e. Guangzhou) in southern China. 
      It is the traditional prestige dialect of Yue. Cantonese is the most common Chinese variety spoken among Chinese Canadians.
      According to Canada 2011 Census, there are nearly 300,000 Canadian residents who reported Cantonese as their mother tongue. 
      However, the number of Cantonese speakers in the country is expected to be greater than those numbers provided by Statistics Canada 
      considering that an additional 297,295 people who reported a Chinese mother tongue did not specify which Chinese variety they were referring to. <br><br>

      The cantonese cuisine is considered bland cuisine with the use of very mild and simple spices in combination.
      Besides pork, beef and chicken, Cantonese cuisine incorporates almost all edible meats, including offal, chicken feet, duck's tongue, snakes,
      and snails. However, lamb and goat are rarely eaten, unlike in the cuisines of northern or western China. The flavours of cantonese dishes are 
      typically well balanced without being greasy. A number of ingredients such as spring onion, sugar, salt, soy sauce, rice wine, cornstarch, vinegar,
      scallion oil, and sesame oil, suffice to enhance flavour, although garlic is heavily used in some dishes, especially those in which internal 
      organs, such as entrails, may emit unpleasant odours. Ginger, chili peppers, five-spice powder, powdered black pepper, star anise and a few other
      spices are also used, but often sparingly.<br><br>
      The cuisine also uses a long list of preserved food items to add flavour to a dish. This may be influenced by Hakka cuisine, 
      since the Hakkas were once a dominant group occupying imperial Hong Kong and other southern territories.
