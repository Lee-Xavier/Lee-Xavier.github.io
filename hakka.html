      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>
      The Asian Restaurant is easily accessible and convenient with a subway station five minutes down the street and 
      several bus stands round the block. The restaurant also has it's own reserved parking area. We firmly believe that
      a sumptuous meal is best enjoyed without having to think about parking nuances. We strive to please. <br><br>

      Our executive chef is Jimmy Xi Chang, of the Easy Chinese Cooking fame, featured in Food Network.
      He also starred as a guest chef in season 5 of Masterchef Australia. His signature dish, the peking duck fillet with 
      white fungus and pork sauce is now an international phenomenon. <br><br>

      To compliment such exemplary culinary skills, Josh Kaper, the renowned hospitality and commercial interior designer, 
      has worked on the decor of the restaurant. Utilizing the existing structure of an old fire department headquarter, 
      the tall arched windows offer pleasant sunlight during the day, and a view of the fast paced nightlife in the
      evenings. The garage shutters have been bolted shut into place and we have retained the old glass panels.
      Red and gold dragons and phoenixes  in abstract shapes adorn the ceiling. It is a beautiful blend of traditional
      and contemporary deisigns.<br><br>

      <h1>THE STORY<h1>
      <p>
      The Hakka chinese, or Han Chinese people are of a migratory tribe, originating from central China centuries ago,
      from provinces like Jiangxi, Guangdong, Sichuan, Hunan etc.The Chinese characters for Hakka (客家) literally mean
      "guest families". The name Han comes from the Han dynasty, which succeeded the short-lived Qin dynasty.<br><br> 
      Under the Han Dynasty, arts and culture flourished, while the dynasty expanded militarily in all directions. 
      his period is considered one of the greatest periods of the history of China, and the Han Chinese take their name 
      from this dynasty. The ancestors of the Hakka have migrated southwards several times because of social unrest,
      upheaval and invasions. When Hakka expanded into areas with pre-existing populations, there was often little 
      agricultural land left for them to farm. Due to their agrarian lifestyle, Hakka have a unique architecture based on
      defense and communal living, and a hearty savory cuisine based on an equal balance between texturised meat and 
      vegetables, and fresh vegetables. Fresh produce was at a premium, forcing the Hakkas to heavily utilize dried and 
      preserved ingredients, such as various kinds of fermented tofu, preserved lime and much use of onion. the texture 
      of food is the hallmark of Hakka cuisine. The skill in Hakka cuisine lies in the ability to cook meat thoroughly 
      without hardening it, and to naturally bring out the proteinous flavour. The food is described as simple, but
      delicious at the same time. <br><br>

      The Hakka people in Toronto are commonly of the first and second generations of Hakka settlers from India.
      Thus, the food cooked by the indian-hakka settlers are heavily influenced by the Indian palatae and Indian spices
      such as red chillies, green chillies, red chilli powder, tandoori masala, cumin and coriander are incorporated into 
      the traditional hakka way of cooking. Due to such dramatic palatial influences, indian hakka food is much different
      from the usually simple food cooked by other ethnic groups.
